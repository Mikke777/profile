    <h2>A bit about me:</h2>
    <p class="description">I was born in Genoa, Italy, and pursued a Master's degree in Passau as part of an Erasmus program. <br> <br> My education has a strong scientific foundation, particularly enhancing my mathematical skills. I hold a Bachelor's degree in International and Diplomatic Science and a Master's degree in International Business and Development. <br>
      <br>
      During my Master's program, I worked as a student employee at FinTecSystems, where I discovered my passion for IT. I especially enjoyed supporting application developers, which sparked my interest in pursuing a career in IT, despite not having a formal education in computer science. <br> <br>

      After graduation, I began my professional career as a Key Account Manager for the Italian market at Tonitrus GmbH, a company specializing in hardware sales. In this role, I leveraged my strengths in communication, organization, and analysis as the primary point of contact for my customers. Additionally, I gained valuable expertise in IT hardware segments, which are crucial for application development.</p>
